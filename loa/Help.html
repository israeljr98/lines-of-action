<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
  Java application implemented by Israel Rodriguez.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first.</li>
  <li>Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
  <li>A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action).</li>
  <li>A piece maybe moved onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece. </li>
  <li>A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures.</li>
  <li>A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.</li>
  <li><strong> GOAL:</strong> Get all of one's pieces into one group of pieces that are connected.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Click a square containing a piece and drag it to where you wish to move it (assuming the move is legal).</li>
  <li>Under the <strong>AI</strong> menu, you can select which player you want to turn into an artificial player.</li>
</ul>
